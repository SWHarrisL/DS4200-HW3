               Diving deeper to my project experience, I've had the opportunity to work on some projects that have helped me develop my skills and understanding of different analytical techniques from different classes while I studied in northeastern unviersity. They all have different difficulty because the entry level course might have relatively easier project. But it help very much on building towards my problem solving skills by applying different challenge to me.

                I still remember my very first project I was working on a unemployment data from BLS. The most difficult thing from that project I think will be using geo-pandas and the geo dataset from US Census Bureau. I have no knowledge towards this library nor how to use this visualization method. In addition, the data contains more tham 10,000 rows with 30 column that include series of different factor for unemployment. But eventually, I find some tutor online and along with the helps of TA and Professor I am able to make a good visualization.

                Another notable project for me will be in my BA core cources. In that class I need to work with SQL and that is a complete new language for me. I am ablt to practice different type of join between different entity which result in granting me a solid understanding towards how the different entity work together and how to code them in mySQL. That was a very fast paste course where I have to learn a lot of different language include SQL, python, excel, and Tableau. By learning and understanding different framework I am able to have more understand towards the language and how to code them and that is how I build a foundation for future classes.
