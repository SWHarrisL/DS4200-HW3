                Welcome to my website! I will share my passion towards data science and a little about myself in this Website.

                I am SioWa, a fourth year Business Analytic and Data Science student in Northeastern University. I have use python, SQL, R,and Tableu in my past coding experience. I have done two coops in Tax and thrid one in winter 2025 in finance. I didn't have too much professional experience towards data science yet but that can not stop my passion from exploreing data and learning from coding. Some topic I really interested in is machine learning and data mining. Since I am both business and data science student, I would like to advance in those two field that I interested in and apply them into my actual job.

                In my free time, I am very a cat person. See the image above will be my cat Poundy. He is a boy and currently weight 13 lbs. This is like a walking pig in the cat species. Don't get me wrong and I love poundy very much! And I also enjoy travel, like this summer I have travel to Chengdu and spending my summer with the pandas which I always didn't get a chance to. This is a wonderful expereince when traveling the stuff you like just like data science. I want to make it not only my concentration but also my hobby so that I could always be passion towards the field in the future.
